                This is great, but keep an eye on any changes that could increase your risk in future. It’s important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to make sure your risk stays low. Our risk of type 2 diabetes increases as we get older, but making healthier choices and maintaining a healthy weight are the best things you can do for your health. Keep active and healthy lifestyle.

                You need to talk about your risk with your doctor and plan what action you're going to take. For some people with prediabetes, early treatment as well as moderate lifestyle changes can actually return blood sugar levels to a normal range, effectively preventing or delaying type 2 diabetes. Ask your doctor plenty of questions and listen to the answers you get. Increase your daily physical activity. Start eating healthy. And your life can be yours again.

                You need to talk about your risk with your doctor and if you discover that you do have prediabetes, remember that it doesn’t mean you’ll develop type 2, particularly if you follow a treatment plan and make changes to your lifestyle through food choices and physical activity. Even small changes can have a huge impact on delaying or preventing diabetes all together.

                If your blood test confirms you have prediabetes, join a CDC-recognized National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) lifestyle change program to learn how to make lasting lifestyle changes to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.
